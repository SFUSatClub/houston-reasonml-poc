# Command Sequence

- **DON'T** modify the files in this folder directly.
- When a user creates a command sequence with `createCommandSequence` mutation, we serialize the command sequence and store it in this directory.
- We want to validate each command sequence before it is uplinked to the OBC, and so the files in this directory are tracked by Git.
- To make it easier to work with the command sequence, I have defined helper functions `readJsonFile` and `writeJsonFile` which return a promise.
- You can access a command sequence by its Id which is returned when the sequence is created.
